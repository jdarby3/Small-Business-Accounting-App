#Small Business Accounting App

This read me explains the final vision for the repo, not what it currently is.

Creating an app that will help a small business easily track and file their financial information.

Inspiratioin was starting a small landscaping business and wanting to have a more automated approach to my accounting than 
inputting into excel, but also something easy to use, free, begginer and small business friendly.

Initial input will be current general ledger, general journal and chart of accounts.

Code should be able to take them, clean up the data, then produce an updated general ledger as well all three financial statements.

From there you can add and subtract accounts, and create journal entries directly in the app, that will update your ledger, coa and statements.

Could integrate an LLM to provide suggestions and feedback based on statements and company goals and infer trends.
