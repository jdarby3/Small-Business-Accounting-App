Goal is to be able to feed in current ledger, journal and coa all as csv and have them update properly, then be able to display that info in a good UI. Also pull the proper info from these to create financial statements and the UI for those as well. Then I want to be able to just give my app journal entries and have everything track and update. 

Could even integrate an LLM to help people make journal entries, making suggestions on debits vs. credits and catching errors, providing insights into finaincial statements

inputting into excel, but also something easy to use, free, begginer and small business friendly
